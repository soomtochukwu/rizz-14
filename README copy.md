# 💘 Rizz-14: The Valentine's Digital Wingman for Nerds

**Finally, a way to confess your feelings without actually talking to anyone.**

Rizz-14 is a **Neo-Pop, AI-powered "Digital Wingman"** built for developers, degens, and chronically online nerds. It scrapes your crush's X (Twitter) profile to generate scientifically calibrated, hyper-specific pickup lines ("Rizz") that slide into their DMs with surgical precision.

## 🧠 How It Works (The "Stealth Mode" Algorithm)

Stop sending generic "Happy Valentine's Day" texts. Rizz-14 uses a sophisticated 3-step process:

1.  **Reconnaissance (Exa.ai)**: We scan their last **365 days of tweets** to find their deep-seated obsessions (e.g., hating Java, loving Formula 1, or buying high at the top).
2.  **Psychological Profiling (Gemini 2.5)**: Our "Telepathic Resonance" engine identifies their "main character energy" without being creepy.
3.  **The Strike**: It generates a 10/10 pickup line that references their niche interest *stealthily*.
    *   *Bad:* "I saw you like Rust."
    *   *Rizz-14:* "i can't promise memory safety but i can promise a date on feb 14. be my valentine? 🦀🔥"

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Neo-Pop Aesthetic**: Halftone dots, brutalist borders, and comic book vibes.
*   **Telepathic Rizz**: AI that knows they hate slow walkers before you even meet them.
*   **Runaway "NO" Button**: The "No" button physically runs away from their cursor. Rejection is literally impossible.* (*Terms apply*)
*   **Crypto Paywall (Optional)**: If they try to reject you 5 times, they have to pay $2 USDT to escape.
*   **Social Proof**: Live counter of how many people have "confessed" today.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (For the Nerds)

*   **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router)
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion (for the smooth button physics)
*   **AI**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash + Exa.ai (Twitter Scraping)
*   **Database**: Supabase
*   **Web3**: wagmi + viem (Polygon USDT integration)
